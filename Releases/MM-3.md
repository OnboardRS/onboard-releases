# Release MM-3 | `14` : `14` pts. | Status: Released
_Release Date: 2022-06-10_


 > This new in-house app allows us to easily make content changes to the resident landing pages and flyers for each property.  We can also “theme” each property to either the provider branding or property specific branding.  Everything to control this is in our content management system - Contentful, so it no longer requires coding/deployment to make changes :raised_hands:
 >We’ve also done a retrofit of the resident experience which includes an updated dashboard for residents.  You can check it out in the screenshots below - props to the dev team, especially 
 >@Nick Zarate
 > and 
 >@Chad Boulton
 > - give them a high five when you see them
